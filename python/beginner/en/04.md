1. You can ask Python to figure out whether a number is bigger, smaller, or the same size as another number. This can be important in all sorts of code (e.g. does the player have as much money as those pants cost?). You do these comparisons using special symbols:
     * *a > b* asks if *a* is bigger than *b*
     * *a < b* asks if *a* is smaller than *b*
     * *a == b* asks if *a* is the same as *b*
     * *a != b* asks if *a* is not the same size as *b*
     * *a >= b* asks if *a* is bigger than, or the same size as *b*
     * *a <= b* asks if *a* is smaller than, or the same size as *b*  

 > ### ==
The double-equals is used to check if things are the same (called **comparison**), because the single equals is already used to set variable values (called **assignment**).

2. The way you make use of these comparisons is inside *if* statements. These are sets of instructions to Python that it should only do if a condition (in the brackets) is true. In this case, it's the *print* statement.
    ```python
      if(my_number > 100):
          print("That's a big number!")
    ```
    > ### Indentation
    The *print* is **indented**. That means that four spaces have been put before it. Python needs these spaces or it won't understand your program.

3. Now, put that little bit of code together with your program from the last card. Change the program so it looks like this:
    ```python
      name = input("What is your name?")
      my_number = input("Hello "+name+" please pick a number")
      my_number = int(my_number)
      print("Your number is "+str(my_number))

      if(my_number > 100):
          print("That's a big number!")
    ```
Now run it and try entering different numbers, above and below 100 to see what happens. What would happen if you entered 100 exactly?
4. You can also combine conditions, using *and* and *or*. So this let's you write code like:
    ```python
      if(my_number >= 20 and my_number < 30):
          print("That number is in the twenties!")
    ```
    Or, for example:
    ```python
      if(food == "Cake" or food == "Chocolate" or food == "Pie"):
          print("Sounds tasty!")
    ```
