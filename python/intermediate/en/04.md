1. You've seen in the last few cards how programmers use loops to save themselves from having to write code to do the same thing over and over. There's another way you can re-use the same code: You can use *functions*.

    *Functions* let you give a label to a piece of code and "call" it using that label from other places in your program. *Print* is a *function* and so are the *list* *functions* for sorting, appending and removing items.

2. You create a function by using the word *def*. If you want to make a function that says hello to people, you can do it like this:
    ```python
    def greet(name):
        print("Hello "+name+"!")
    ```
    This *function* is called "greet" and you must pass it a *variable* called *name* when you call it. Here's an example of how you'd use it:
    ```python
    def greet(name):
        print("Hello "+name+"!")
    # You can have any amount of code between them, but the function has to be above the place where you call it.
    greet("Bob")
    ```
*Functions* are particularly useful where you need to do the same thing in several different places in your code.
3. You can do a lot more in a **function** than just speed up a little bit of code. Here's a more useful example, where we use an "add_person" **function**. Try running this code and using it.
    ```python
    people = []
    # Create a function to put people on the list
    def get_person():
      # Collect information about the person
      person_name = input("What is their name?")
      person_age = int(input("How old are they?"))
      # Turn that information into a dictionary
      person = {
        "name" : person_name,
        "age" : person_age
      }
      # Give back the person
      return person

    # Here's a short program using it
    person_count = int(input("Add how many people?"))
    for count in range(person_count):
      people.append(get_person())
    print("You've added "+str(person_count)+" people!")
    print("Here they are: "+str(people))
    ```
This *function* doesn't take any inputs, asks a few questions and then *returns* the result as a "person" *dictionary* which is *appended* to a *list* of "people".
