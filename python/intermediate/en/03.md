1. *Lists* are very useful, but there are some things that it's very hard to do with them. Let's try to keep some info pets. You could do this:
```python
pet_names = ["Fluffy", "Spot", "Felix"]
pet_type = ["Rabbit", "Dog", "Cat"]
pet_size = ["Small", "Medium", "Large"]
pet_eats = ["Carrots", "Bones", "Fish"]
```
But, this makes it hard to add things and means you can't *sort* them, since they're not connected.

2. We can solve this problem by using another new type of *variable*, closely related to the *list*: the *dictionary*. The you can look up the *values* in the dictionary with the *key*. Try it in your code!
     ```python
    fluffy = {
        "name" : "Fluffy",
        "type" : "rabbit",
        "size" : "small",
        "eats" : "carrots"
    }
    # And so on for Spot and Felix, but I have to fit this on a card!
    # We can get information out by passing the right keys.
    print(fluffy["name"]+" is a "+fluffy["size"]+" "+fluffy["type"]+" who likes to eat "+fluffy["eats"]+".")
     ```

3. You may be thinking "If I had to print out all the pets, I'd be doing the same thing over and over agin. I should be able to use a *for* loop!" You can, but you need to put the *dictionary* in a *dictionary* (or a *list*):
```python
# Make an empty dictionary
pets = { }
# Adding a pet to the dictionary is simple
pets["fluffy"] = {
     "name" : "Fluffy",
     "type" : "rabbit",
     "size" : "small",
     "eats" : "carrots"
}
pets["spot"] = {
     "name" : "Spot",
     "type" : "dog",
     "size" : "large",
     "eats" : "bones"
}
pets["felix"] = {
     "name" : "Felix",
     "type" : "cat",
     "size" : "medium",
     "eats" : "fish"
}
# Now you can go through these pets with a loop.
# Note: you use two sets of square brackets.
for pet in pets:
    print(pets[pet]["name"]+" is a "+pets[pet]["size"]+" "
    +pets[pet]["type"]+" who likes to eat "+pets[pet]["eats"]".")    
 ```
