1. What if you wanted to store a bunch of information? Say, for example, the names of everyone at your Dojo? For this, Python has another type of *variable*: the *list*. It looks like this:
    ```python
    list_of_names = ["Alice","Bob","Chris"]
    list_of_numbers = [1,2,3,4,5]
    ```  
2. *Lists* are really useful. To start with, it's easy to print out the whole *list*.
    ```python
    names = ["Chis","Alice","Bob","Emma","Danny"]
    print(names)
    ```

3. How about counting how many items are in the *list*? That's easy! Use the *len( )* function. It's short for length. Update your code and try it:
    ```python
    names = ["Chis","Alice","Bob","Emma","Danny"]
    names_count = len(names)
    print("There are "+str(names_count)+" names.")
    ```
4. Nice! Now, what if you want to get the first name on the *list*? You use square brackets after the variable name, with the position of the item you want into the brackets. **Notice that computers count from 0!**

    ```python
    print("The first name is "+ names[0]+".")
    ```
5. You can create a copy of a *list* (so, for example, you can change one without changing the other), like this:
    ```python
    copy_of_names = list(names)
    ```
6. What if someone new needs to be added? You can do that with the *append* method. Append basically means "stick on the end". It works like this:
    ```python
    names.append("George")
    ```
Try adding a few names to your *list* now. Use the names of some of the people around you.

7. Ok, now how do you take a name off the *list*? Again, Python has made this pretty easy for you. You just use the *remove* method, like this:
    ```python
    names.remove("Bob")
    ```
8. Finally, it's possible to totally reverse the order of a list by using the *reverse* method, like this:
    ```python
    names.reverse()
    ```
<!-- What about dictionaries, or tuples -->
