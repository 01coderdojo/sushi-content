1. Your website is really coming together! It's starting to look like something a pro coder would build! One last trick that you'll have seen on loads of websites. It's called a *lightbox*: you click on an image, or button, or anything really, and the screen dims and something else (often a bigger version of that image) appears.

2. You're going to build this on your projects page, so you can copy it for however many projects you have. Open *projects.html* and in the **content** *div* add the following (feel free to use other images if you want!):
    ```html
    <a href="#box1">
      <img src="http://placehold.it/150x150text=thumb1" class="thumbnail">
    </a>

    <a href="#_" class="lightbox" id="box1">
        <h3>Project Name</h3>
        <img src="http://placehold.it/400x300?text=box1">
        <p>Project description</p>
    </a>
    ```
  A *thumbnail* is the name given to the small image that is clicked on to show the larger image. You're just going to use one for now, to understand how this works, but you can use a whole bunch of them later, maybe in a *table*, to show off all your projects!

3. Now for the *CSS*. There are a few clever bits in here, that I'll explain afterwards. As usual, this all goes in *style.css*:

    ```css
    .lightbox{
        background: rgba(0,0,0,0.8);
        color: #fff;
        height: 100%;
        left: 0;
        position: fixed;
        text-align: center;
        text-decoration: none;
        top: 0;
        visibility: hidden;
        width: 100%;
        z-index: 999;
    }

    .lightbox:target {
        outline: none;
        visibility: visible;
    }
    ```
    * The *lightbox* is hidden most of the time, by *visibility: hidden*
    * It has *position: fixed*, which means it will stay in place even if you scroll the page. With its width and height, it takes over the whole page.
    * Turn off the *text-decoration* to avoid underlining everything inside the *a* tag.
    * The *lightbox:target* class only applies when the *lightbox* was the *target* of the last *hyperlink* clicked. So clicking anywhere will switch the *visibility* back to *hidden* and hide the *lightbox*!
