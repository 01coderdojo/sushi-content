1. Next, you're going to update your *about.html* page to include a picture of your online avatar (if you don't have one, just grab something cool off the web â€” personally, I like to use kitten pictures).

  Make sure the picture is square so you turn it into a circle using just HTML and CSS! Save it into *img* as *profile_pic* with the correct *extension* (.jpg, .png, etc. depending on its format).

2. On the *about.html* page, add these bits of HTML to your *content* div:
  ```html
  <div class="picture-heading">
      <h2>Who am I?</h2>
      <img src="img/profile_pic.[extension]" />
  </div>
  ```

3. Add the following to *style.css* to setup the basics of your cool new heading.
    ```css
    .picture-heading {
      height: 150px;
      margin: 10px 0;
      position: relative;
    }
    ```  
    Here you're setting *position: relative* so you can set the *img* and *h2* tags to have *position: absolute*, which lets you place them one on top of the other, with the right CSS!
4. Next, set the properties on the image inside the *picture-heading*. You use *.picture-heading img* (*img* tags inside something with the *picture-heading* class) as the identifier for this:
    ```css
    .picture-heading img {
    height: 150px;
    border-radius: 50%;
    z-index: 40;
    position: absolute;
    left: 20px;
    border: 2px solid #ddd;
    }
    ```
    There are a few interesting bits this time:
      * Setting the *border-radius* to 50% makes the picture round
      * The *z-index* controls what appears over it. Higher ones go on top.
      * Setting the position to *absolute* and then using the *left* property, to move it in 20 pixels from the left of the *.picture-heading*.
5. Finally, you need to set the properties on the heading itself.
    ```css
    .picture-heading h2 {
      position: absolute;
      line-height: 100px;
      height: 100px;
      padding: 0 0 0 190px;
      width: 100%;
    }
    ```
