1. Open *style.css* and add the following (or change it around, you know what you're doing by now!):
    ```css
    .menu-button {
      background-color: #0093D5;
      border: 1px solid #CCCCCC;
      border-radius: 5px;
      color: #ffffff;
      display: inline-block;
      font-family: "Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
      margin: 5px;
      padding: 5px 10px;
      text-align: center;
      text-decoration:none;
    }
    ```
    > ### Font Choice
    Notice that the same fonts are used here as for the headings on the rest of the site. This helps the navigation stand out.

2. You're going to put in a transition. First, tell *.menu-button* how to handle it, so add this line to the *.menu-button* class in your *style.css*:
    ```css
    transition: all 0.2s ease-out;
    ```
  This tells it to take 0.2 seconds and to slow down near the end.

3. Now you just need to use the *:hover* selector to change what the button looks like when a user puts their mouse cursor over it, like this:
    ```css
    .menu-button:hover {
        box-shadow: 0 2px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.2);
        transform: translateY(-2px);
    }
    ```
    This gives the button a shadow and moves it on the *Y-axis* (up/down) by 2 pixels.
    > ### Play with it!
      Try changing the *hover* behaviour. Play with size, colour and time!

4. Now you've got a menu! Add a title (*h1*) and logo (*img*), if you like, to your *header*, above the menu. Then add "Made by [your name here]" to the *footer*. The template's done! Time to build some pages with it!

5. Save *template.html* and then copy its contents. Paste that into *index.html*, *about.html* and *projects.html* and save all of them.

6. Go to *index.html* and add a few paragraphs welcoming people to your site. Maybe tell them where they can learn to build one of their own! Now you've got a website!
