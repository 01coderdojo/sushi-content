1. On this card, you're going to setup your template page. First, open *template.html* and create the outline of a standard *html* file:
    ```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
        <head>
        </head>

        <body>
        </body>
    </html>
    ```

2. Now, include your *stylesheet* in the *head* section, and add a place to put the titles of you page. Mark it with a *comment*.
    ```html
    <head>
        <title><!-- Page title goes here --></title>
        <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="css/style.css"/>
    </head>
    ```

3. Next, create the three *div* tags that almost every webpage has. Give them classes to match their roles (e.g. *class="header"*):
  * First a *header* div: Contains the menu and website title
  * Then a *content* div: Where the main content of the page (like your gallery of projects) goes.
  * Finally, a *footer* div: Contains less important or obvious links to things like a "contact me" page.

4. You should come up with the basic styles to use across your website: Fonts, text sizes, spacing, colours, etc. and put them in your *style.css* file.

  You already know enough CSS from the Beginner and Intermediate cards to write your own styles, but here are some that you can play around with. Notice that I try to make *headings* and *body text* noticeably different.
    ```css
    * {
        box-sizing: border-box;
      }

    body {
      font-family: "Times New Roman", serif;
      margin: 10px 0 0 0;
      padding: 0 10%;
    }

    h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 {
      background-color: #49B749;
      color: #ffffff;
      font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
      padding: 0 0 10px 10px;
      width:100%;
    }
    ```
    > ### CSS Properties
      In this code I've used a number of CSS *properties* you've seen before. However, there are dozens of them. You'll learn them as you need them. You can look them up on a website like [dojo.soy/cssprops](http://dojo.soy/cssprops)
