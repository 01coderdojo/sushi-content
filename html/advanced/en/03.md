1. The next few cards will show you how to make an awesome menu for your website by applying some clever styling to *hyperlinks*. This is a cooler version of the menu you made with the Beginner Sushi Cards. Start by opening *template.html* and adding a list of links to the *header* div tag, like this:

  ```html
  <div class="header">
    <nav>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="index.html">Home</a></li>
            <li><a href="about.html">About Me</a></li>
            <li><a href="projects.html">Projects</a></li>
        </ul>
    </nav>
  </div>
  ```
  > ### Nav Tags
    The *nav* tag tells the browser (and tools used by people who have visual impairments) that this piece of the page is the *navigation*, used to get around the website.

2. Load *template.html* in your browser. It doesn't look like much, does it? You need to make that list look cool! You can do this, of course, by adding some *classes* and some *CSS*. Add a *menu* class to the *ul* tag and a *menu-button* class to each of the *a* tags.
3. Now, you're going to update the *CSS* in *style.css* bit by bit, so you can watch your changes.

  First, make the list arrange itself like a menu:
    ```css
    .menu{
      margin: 5px auto 10px auto;
      list-style:none;
      text-align: center;
      display: flex;
      justify-content: space-between;
    }

    .menu > li {
      display: inline-block;
    }
    ```
    > ### Flex
      The *display: flex* in *.menu* is pretty powerful. The details of using *flex* to lay out pages would take a whole Sushi Series on its own, but you can learn more at [dojo.soy/a-html-flex](dojo.soy/a-html-flex).

4. You've got a menu that connects your pages and it's in the right place, you can make it cooler! You've already got the classes in place, so now you just need to add some more *CSS*. You'll find it on the next card!
